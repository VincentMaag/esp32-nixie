Here we will implmenet our webserver stuff, which should be seperate from wifi/initializing.

We will hopefully be able to implement a sort of wifi-class where we can "add" webserver-if statements, maybe with vectors or stuff like that.
This way we won't have to manipulate weberver.cpp if we choose to add more functionality

Could also be that this is very far fetched, as any webserver will be very different to the next. Maybe we will just have a
data structure or a class where we can pass data more elegantly between our webserver applikation and any kind of main-function or what not...

We will include maag_webserver with some sort of global class to throw around data
